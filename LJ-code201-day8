# LJ Code 201 - Day 8

Okay so I walked into class today, kind of feeling a little hopeless as to where to start and end. Fortunately, that was solved over our 2hr session after lunch. I realized that I had all that I needed and then some and after working on it with Sam, I <b>realized</b> where I went wrong.

All in all, today was a pretty productive day besides the fact that <i>I didn't really get to work on the lab due tonight...</i> oh well I'm confident that I'll figure it out! <b>:)


PS I'm just checkout how md works.
