# LJ Code 201 - Day 7

Today was excruciating for me at first, until I had a few pointers on how the structure of my app.js file should look, as well as how my table should look. As a visual, ad kinesthetic learner it's imparative that I always (mostly at least) layout my thoughts on paper (thanks to Frazier's reminder!). All in all, I'm not too close to the finish line, but at least I can see it.
