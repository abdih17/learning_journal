# LJ Code 201 - Day 2

So I kind of had a pretty rough day, I got off on the wrong station and then I got lost for a little bit; therefore, making me about 45 minutes late to class. I was horrified, and truly disoriented throughout the entire lecture portion of the course. (Oh, did I also forget to mention that I am EXTREMELY sick, and probably the number-one disrupter of the class because of it?!?)

Putting all of that to the side, I honestly think I'm getting the hang of being a little independent, but knowing in the back of my head that I have a safety net of TAs and of course Sam. I plan on dedicating the majority of my weekend trying to catch up, and edit my previous assignments. I need to build my confidence in Javascript a little more for comfort.
