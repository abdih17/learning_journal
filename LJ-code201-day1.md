h1- # LJ Code 201 - Day 1

I feel like I've learned a lot, but something I'm realizing is that I need to catch up on Javascript, quickly! I can't believe I actually kept up today becasue I don't quite know a whole lot about coding in Javascript or using Git/GitHub. Hopefully, I can keep up with tomorrow's class because I definitely plan on catch up tonight using Lynda(?), and also continue working on Codecademy.
I'm hopeing that tomorrow will run just as smoothly as today. :)
