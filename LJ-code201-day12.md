# LJ Code 201 - Day 12

**Prepare yourself for a rant that includes a whole lot of curse words, and CAPS (<-- yup a lot of that, for emphasis not because I'm not yelling... a lot) and sort of a Sheila Buff's "JUST DO IT!" spin-off.

These past two days of lab has been pretty pitiful! I actually fucking cried on Monday (which is a first for me!) right when I got into my car because of feeling so sick and tire of feeling like the biggest idiot in the class. 

I swear there was a time I got complex concepts easily, I mean I took AP and honors course all through high school, I've never failed an administered exam (I usually don't even study for it too!), and I graduated with a 3.8 GPA from CWU (yes I've taken all three Calc classes, Anatomy and Physiology, every science series just for the 'fun' of it). There was a freaking time I felt like gaining knowledge was a piece of fucking cake. that WAS a time I'm having a really have time believing even existed.

I GOTTA BE THE STUPIDEST PERSON IN CLASS, BUT WHO GIVES A FUCK! I'M GOING TO GET THE FUCK THROUGH THIS SHIT, BECAUSE I DON'T FUCKING KNOW HOW TO QUIT! 

I'M. GOING. TO. FUCKING. DO. IT. 

I going to start off by working my ass off and I'm going to be the FUCKING BEST in class.. by the 401 class of course- I have to be a little realistic here since I'm still a beginner to coding altogether! 

Steps to becoming the best in class:
1. Hire a tutor! (I've been looking into hiring a regular tutor for all three courses (which will cost me a pretty dime or two, BUT WHO GIVES A FUCKING SHIT... I really do actually give some fucks, but I'M JUST GOING TO FUCKING HAVE TO DO IT, right?)

2. Sleep a whole lot less (I asked Benny how he's been getting by, and he literally said "I don't sleep." so I'm taking that as a green light that this is the WAY TO THE LIGHT AT THE END OF A SLEEPLESS NIGHT. SO...FUCK YOU, SLEEP!)

3. Meditate regularly, and maybe figure some things out.
